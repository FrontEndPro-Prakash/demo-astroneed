                  <p>We generally hear people blaming Kundli Dosha or (Kundli Dosh) for every failure and shortcoming in life. Whatever bad or undesired happens in life, the cause is comfortably shifted to kundli dosha that might or might not present in a person's kundli. It is very important to find out whether the kundli doshas are actually present in the kundli.</p>
                  <p>Ask further to know the relevance, types, general effects and effective remedies of doshas in a kundli. </p>

                            <p>am Mukesh Shah, Ex-Chief Manager of PSU Bank, Mumbai, have been taking the consultations from Mr. Pavitra Sodhi, since 2015 initially when my daughter was not having any Child after marriage of over 9 years. We had done various religious tours for blessings as advised by people & experts got done some pooja also but of all without success. Sodhi Sir, just asked for my daughter's birth date, time and place of birth, after analysis of my daughter's birth chart told confidently that she would get a child in 2016. As he predicted my daughter got pregnant in March 2016.</p>
                            <p>However, in June month during medical checkup the Doctor sensed and observed some problems in fetus and informed that it might be aborted due to poor development and other issues. We were very frightened, terrified & depressed and went to our religious guruji who consoled us. At that difficult juncture myself again approached Mr. Sodhi and sought his advise. He on deep analysis of my daughter's birth chart informed us that the Child could be saved normally and advised us few small small & easy remedies, which we did very honestly and religiously. Finally, the Child was born Normally in December 2016. The Child and Mother were quite hale & Healthy.</p>
                            <p>We are very grateful to Sodhi ji for helping us sincerely. Thereafter we have been regularly approaching him for any issue for our family members, myself and my friend circle and found his calculations and predictions Very Accurate, Correct, Focused and to the Point. I always suggest his name to the people in my circle for getting Accurate analysis, prediction and remedies. May God Bless him in all his endeavors.</p>

                            <p>Myself, Ashish Jamidar, Director, Accon BPS Limited. Leicester, UK. We have first met Mr. P. Sodhi in year 2017 when I was working as a middle management professional of an Indian Multinational Public Limited company of Central India. Whilst I was reasonably positioned professionally, things had become harder as I was climbing up the ladder. I was looking to change my job for betterment and to get rid of ongoing work issues, resultantly also affecting my personal life.</p>
                            <p>Based on my birth-chart analysis, Mr Sodhi advised me to continue with my present job and indicated a rise in 2018. I was delighted when his predictions came to reality when I was promoted as on-board Executive Director and Vice President- Marketing of the company. All this happened during exact time-scale predicted by him.</p>
                            <p>Mr Sodhi also advised me to expect some more good things in professional life going forward. However, based on prevalent circumstances of that time, I wasn't hopeful of anything better in near future.</p>
                            <p>According to his predictions, in early 2019, another opportunity knocked in when a European company offered me Senior Management Position based in the UK.</p>
                            <p>I was in two minds about making a 360-degree change from a well-established job. On consultation with Mr Sodhi, I did make a change and it turned out well. I moved to UK in early 2020 and touchwood, despite global pandemic, things are running well so far just in line with his predictions.</p>
                            <p>According to my personal experience of past few years, I highly regard Mr Sodhi for his deeper knowledge and understanding of Astrology, Accuracy in Analysis of birth charts and Precision & Perfection in Predictions with a given time line. I would recommend him to all in my known circle and others who may get benefitted by consulting him.</p>

During our formal interaction with him we came to know about his interests in Astrology. He talked about our major events in the past just by knowing our date of birth, time & place. Later on I consulted him regarding some issues in my family. He is a very cheerful person and always explains the Planetary reasons behind his Predictions and Remedies. His Predictions about birth of my Child, my Professional Growth and the major negative event in my family were Accurate. His Remedies are very easy to follow and understand but he always says that the events which are written in your fortune will certainly happen and with the help of Remedies we can only decrease the negative effects of these events. I always recommend to my relatives and friends to consult Pavitra Sodhi Sir whenever they are in need. I thank Sodhi Sir for his help during the years. Thank you Sir.</p>

His Astrological Analysis gave me a different perspective to my life itself. Initially he just asked me about my date of birth, place and time, and Ohhhh my God, he came up with so accurate Assessment of my entire life. Results of his predictions were So Accurate that it was Unbelievable. He very correctly told me about my inner personality character traits which I only knew. He has great Spiritual qualities, well-grounded, Sharp, Genuine & Focussed in predictions.</p>
                            <p>At that time when my family was harping for my marriage & nothing was clicking despite best efforts of my parents. He advised my father counselled him and we got one pooja done from our family Guruji. Mr. Sodhi told me in advance that my Spouse would be Fair, Tall, intelligent & bhagyashali which came entirely True when I got finally engaged.</p>
                            <p>Whether it was education, Job, marriage, health, family and career etc., every single thing with perfect Pin on the time period of events. I am a Super Fan of this gentlemen. He is fast & immensely accurate with his predictions which shows his comprehensive understanding of astrology. During my difficult times he gave me a lot of hope, encouragement and promise.</p>
                            <p>In 2017 he asked me to appear for the promotion exams for which initially I was not at all interested. He pursued with me and convinced that it was time to avail that opportunity & finally I appeared and got promoted to Managerial level.</p>
                            <p>In 2020 Sodhi Sir again followed with me to go for my first child. After my conception, he told about my child in advance & also about cesarean delivery. He advised us the most opportune time for the delivery which we followed. The child is hale & healthy & doing well, everything happened as he told.</p>
                            <p>Our family also consult in Numerology matters and take his advice, guidance & seen his predictions coming True.</p>
                            <p>He is a compassionate person with Positive method of communication & counsels with necessary modifications in our persona, to be adopted for a better life experience.</p>
                            <p>I hold him in the highest esteem bcoz whatever he told me; I fully endorse it was Correct. I have great pleasure in recommending him for his remarkable Astrological qualities of making predictions without error. Amazingly he could simply describe past events with ease.</p>
                            <p>My wish that he scales greater heights in his area of expertise. Those who need advice should contact him ASAP. Trust me you will be happy and positively surprised. May God bless him with long active life serving the cause of people.</p>

                            <p>My husband, who was a non-believer of astrology, really appreciates Mr. Sodhi, who told him in 2008, years before our marriage, quite the details like “you and your wife would be in same firm”, his travelling period, even the kind of locations. He also guided me from 2000-2011, in my Career growth path, my Travel, my Marriage, Problems and how to deal with them. He also told me well in advance about my Sickness, which made me conscious and helped me to reduce its affects. He helped me in my Personality Development by telling my Strengths and Weaknesses.</p>
                            <p>His counselling is like a GEM to me. He is a person of great knowledge, high intellect and Trust.</p>
                            <p>I would definitely recommend & endorse him for any astrological counselling. In-fact in past, few of my friends sought his guidance on my recommendations and they couldn't be merrier! He helped one of my friends, who went through a tough phase of broken engagement and betrayal, his selfless support at the time was the confidence to my friend in overcoming that difficult time and move on.</p>

So I must say that Sodhi uncle presents a very Good SWOT Analysis in his Astro Consultancy which is very Clear, very Accurate, very Resourceful and very Helpful. It will surely help you all to overcome difficulties. Thank you very much.</p>

                            <p>He was in Ahmedabad; I discussed my problems & Sir gave me lot of strength and Positive side of my future. Accordingly, I started working on that and no wonder though the problems were there but with Solutions and Positivity given by Sir, I managed the things so well that now I could not believe that.</p>
                            <p>Since then till today that is August 2021, I am taking his guidance for very small small things which gave me motivation and ultimate solutions. His Predictions to Own house, children education, my vehicle etc. came very True exactly as per time period given by Sodhi Sir.</p>
                            <p>He also said that my children will be professionally qualified that everything happened in my life as per predictions of Sodhi Sir. Best part of his guidance is that he will say & focus only on positive side of our future, in that aspects the person focuses only on positive side and gets best out of it.</p>
                            <p>During bad patch, many times I used to get so depressed in my career that with his guidance and remedies I really performed well.</p>
                            <p>His analysis, guidance, motivation and remedies really worked well for my other family members.</p>
                            <p>I am thankful to Sodhi Sir for helping and guiding our family. He proved an angel sent by God to help & guide us. God bless him in his all endeavours.</p>

My building had gone into redevelopment and for the last three years things were not happening as per agreement and the matter had gone into disputes with the builder of housing society. I was very worried and consulted Sh. Sodhi Saheb who on his calculations told me that from March 2018 to April 2018, I would get possession of my new flat. Accordingly, in April 2018, the society received OC of the building and we got possession. I was very happy for the accurate guidance given by Sodhi Saheb. He assured me that my work would be done within the given time and not to worry much. I was so happy that there is someone who could give so beautiful & correct guidance in astrological matters in my life. Sodhi saheb I thank you very very much.</p>

I was in and out of jobs; with his guidance from period 2005 onwards, it was easy to overcome that time.</p>
                            <p>He is quite Accurate and very Confident about his Predictions, like once my nephew got engaged and we asked Mr. Sodhi for the kundli match, and he did not see this match to go forward, and few days before the wedding, due to some disagreements, that did not work. He also predicted accurate time for his wedding.</p>
                            <p>In year 2001, He warned that my daughter would face gynaecological problem in future and right now she is going through one. He also told us quite well in advance that my daughter will go for a marriage of her choice, he also told that she would marry in 28th year of age. Also, in 2008 my daughter moved to different project in her firm, where she faced a lot of stress and resistance from team mates, on consulting Mr. Sodhi in Oct. 2008, he said it is better for her in new project, if she remained in her old project, she would had been fired. And in January 2009, her old firm went into financial crisis and everyone from earlier team lost their jobs.</p>
                            <p>He also consoled us in 2007, telling it is not the time to build a house, when we were suffering for financial crisis and also trying hard to buy a house, His guidance helped us then a lot, he told us that 2015 would be a good year to invest in property and results will be fruitful and we recently bought one.</p>
                            <p>In 2019 my son lost his job & was very depressed & frustrated since not getting another one. We approached Mr. Sodhi, who assured us that he was going to get good Job by May 2019 and advised few small remedies, which we followed. It worked very correctly as per time period given by him & my son is well placed in his job now in Pune.</p>
                            <p>Overall, Mr. Sodhi has been very helpful to me and my family, whenever we required his inputs. He is a man with True and Advance level of knowledge in Astrology.</p>

                            <p>1) He had advised us to take chance for a 2nd Child for which we were not prepared earlier. We took it as per the “date and time” he suggested and I got conceived.</p>
                            <p>2) He had predicted that he (child) will be very sharp and intelligent which is absolutely true. The boy is very sharp and his grasping is also very high.</p>
                            <p>3) He had predicted that boy will be beautiful and it is also true</p>
                            <p>4) He only had suggested his name as “Dhairya” which we accepted.</p>

                            <p>I met him in November 2015 in respect with the acute problem of Headache & Migraine with fear Psychosis of my son. Prior to meeting with him, we had been consulting many doctors and got done CT Scan /MRI also but of no relief. My son used to complain of Severe headaches & giddiness etc. which aggravated during his class tests and exams.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sodhi prepared his astrological chart and Analyzed his problem which was very accurate & convincing as if he had himself seen my son suffering. Few small remedial measures suggested by him have really worked Wonders and my son is totally fit now and have been attempting his tests/exams very comfortably. His school rating is also improved. Sodhi ji 's knowledge of Astrology is very advanced and scientific analysis with small remedial measures is very helpful to the people. May God Bless him…</p>
